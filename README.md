# GIPHY TV

**I created a website that displays giphs, user can watchs giphs like watching TV. about an specific topic.** 
I used [Giphy](giphy.com) API for this project. [Giphy](giphy.com) allows us to access their data with using an API for free. 

## How Giphy Search Engine works:
- This is the UI of main page:

- The user enters a keyword about what kind of giphs he/she looks for. Then user clicks the button or enter key for watching.

- This is the UI of about us page:

## How to use Giphy API:
In [Giphy](giphy.com) website, there is a detailed documentation about how to use Giphy API but I will briefly explain how I used it.
- There is an URL that I have to add my project to acces to the data. 
- Each URL has an unique API Key.
- I signed up to the [Giphy](giphy.com). Then I navigated to the [Giphy Developers](developers.giphy.com/docs/) section.
- I clicked to the *Create an App* button to get the API Key.

## AJAX
AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX enables data to be sent and received to and from a database/server. Data is grabbed with AJAX request.
